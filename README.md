# LZW_Compression
This is a desktop application which uses lzw compression algorithm.
You can see encoded and decoded files (Text, image.png and PDF).
Everything is implemented in python at LZW_Compression.py, algorithms and GUI. Because of that, perfomance could suffer :/
Please use small files <3
